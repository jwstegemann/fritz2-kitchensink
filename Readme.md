# fritz2 Components Demo

These are the demo pages for set of ready-to-go components for building reactive themeable web-apps,
following a consistent constraint-based design system using fritz2.

The showcases demonstrate the features, styling, and usage of the fritz2 components. Remember that this is a preview release.
Most components still need some work, others are not implemented yet, and the API still needs to be completed and streamlined.
