# fritz2 Components Demo

These are the demo pages for set of ready-to-go components for building reactive themeable web-apps,
following a consistent constraint-based design system using fritz2.

The showcases demonstrate the features, styling, and usage of the fritz2 components. Remember that this is an alpha release.
Some components are quite stable yet, but others still need some work and the API still needs some polishing and streamlining.
