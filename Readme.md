# fritz2 Components Demo

These pages showcase a set of ready-to-go components for building reactive themeable web-apps,
following a consistent constraint-based design system using the fritz2 ui framework.

The showcases demonstrate the features, styling, and usage of the fritz2 components.
Some components are stable already, but others still need some work, and the API still needs some polishing and streamlining.
